# HGEN396: Human Genetics Research Project

## Simulating Detachment of Tumor Cell Clusters

======

Repository for code, learning scripts and projects for HGEN 396 project at McGill University.

### Project Accomplishments

- [x] Tested the feasibility of using the Cellular Potts Model (Glazier 1992) to model Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) and Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters (CTC clusters)

- [x] Ran races of different sizes of CTC clusters

### Description of Repository Contents

- `documents` - contains report written for HGEN 396
- `practice` - contains practice scripts written when playing with GPU computing
- `models` - contains all implemented models

#### `Models`

1. `graphModel` - Contains a graph model (simplistic)
2. `simpleLinearModel` - Contains models which conform to Hypergeometric and Binomial Distributions
3. `cellularPottsModel` - Contains the CPM implemented in python. This directory contains alot of 'test' files for examples of how to use the model. (* warning: it is not reccomended to use this in real life work, this repository was a proof of concept * )
